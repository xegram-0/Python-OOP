# Exercise 8: Determine if School_bus is also an instance of the Vehicle class
# Given:

# class Vehicle:
#     def __init__(self, name, mileage, capacity):
#         self.name = name
#         self.mileage = mileage
#         self.capacity = capacity

# class Bus(Vehicle):
#     pass

# School_bus = Bus("School Volvo", 12, 50)

class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, name, mileage, capacity):
        self.name = name
        self.mileage = mileage
        self.capacity = capacity

class Bus(Vehicle):
    pass

School_bus = Bus("School Volvo", 12, 50)

if isinstance(School_bus,Vehicle):
    print("School_bus is an instance of Vehicile.")
else:
    print("School_bus is not an instance of Vehicle.")
